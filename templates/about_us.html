			as olds want a health care, for deplacment to stay where he needs to be.
			the second argument is the disables. they have rights to study,

			not least parents they spend all days in working and rare to be avaible
			to take care for their kids. in that case children without control and satisfaction for their needs

			<p>
			A caregiver is someone who cares for the health and well-being of a person who needs help with daily tasks and activities.
			Your aging loved one may need a caregiver due to an injury, an illness, limited mobility, memory issues, or chronic conditions
			that make everyday chores more challenging.

			<h1>Note:</h1>
			<p>
				some of the duties of an elderly caregiver can include cleaning, grocery shopping, cooking, 
				managing medications, and helping with medical appointments. However, caregiver responsibilities 
				will ultimately depend on health and needs of the person under care.
